	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Stuffnearto.me started out as a university final year project, but now it is a national project for everyone to benefit from. It sprung from the idea that there wasn't a website in my area that listed local entertainment information. I wanted a Chinese one night and couldn't find the menu; I realised how useful it would be to be able to go online and get all the information I needed, so I started work on this. One area grew to one county, and that grew further until it stretched the whole of the UK.</p>
	<p>It was always important to me that the website incorporated user-generated content. I gave the basics, but I cannot travel the length and breadth of the UK getting all the information needed. Each local area requires people putting on their own pages for their favourite place to go and give reviews for a place that they have enjoyed for the benefit of others; which is why this website is constantly changing and evolving. </p>
	<p>This project can only get bigger and better; with help from the users. </p>
